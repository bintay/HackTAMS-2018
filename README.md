## HackTAMS 2018 Project

Update: This project placed 1st!

Demo: http://tams.club/ (currently hosted on an angry raspberry pi, so it might not work)

So this was my first hackathon

The code quality is... less than desirable

Node modules weren't ignored because I didn't have a package.json initially because I'm a stupid with no mangos :/

It's a club management app featuring
- A login system
- Club sign ins
- A newsfeed
- A calendar
- Volunteering sign ups
- Volunteer hour tracker
- Profiles
